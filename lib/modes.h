/**
 * In theory these modes are the ones that actually affect the outcome of calculations.
 * For example multiplication only reuturns the same signed and unsigned value for the
 * low (16 bits) half of a 32 bit value.
 * Because the imult instruction must be used to get the full 32bit result, both the
 * signed and unsigned values must be stored. Addition and subtraction would
 * be the same so it's unneccesary for this case.

 * form (in any base). For example 10.5 or 0xA.8
 *
 * Or whether they are displayed in machine form, which would be the binary representation

 *
 * For signed ints it determines whether they are displayed with a Â± sign (Human) or wether
 * they are displayed as twos complement (Machine).
 *
 * For unsigned ints there is no difference...
